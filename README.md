Hi, I'm Sawad Kazi, a biochemistry honors student at the University of Texas at Austin, minoring in computer science.
I'm interested in studying the cancer genome and tumor microenvironment as a scientist and a clinician to design more effective cancer treatments and therapeutics.
I aspire to conduct my own research in cancer genomics and gene therapy using bioinformatics and computational statistics and to pair that research with clinical
practice to ask more principled questions.
